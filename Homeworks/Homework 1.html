    <pre>Textbook problems:<br><br>  1.3, 1.5, 1.11, 1.13, 1.18, 1.19, 2.2, 2.4, 2.11, 2.12, 2.18, 2.23, 2.24<br><br>Extra Credit:<br><br>  Let's consider the cost model for flooding to be directly proportional<br>  to the total number of times nodes have to process a packet (either send<br>  or receive). What is the order of the worst and best case cost of sending<br>  a message from any node to any other node (not including reply messages)<br>  within this model? What are the topologies that produces these two cases?<br>  Assume there are N nodes in the network; the answers should be in terms of<br>  O(f(N)).<br><br>  Trivial cases such as node A sends to node B, which is its only<br>  neighbor, will not be accepted, because they cannot be generalized!<br></pre>
