<body>
Each homework question is graded on a 3 point (0-2) scale. This scale
is based on how well you demonstrate understanding of the course
material. What you turn in should be legible and clearly show your
work, but should <b>not</b> be excessively long.
<br>
<br>
0: nothing turned in<br>
1: demonstrated some understanding<br>
2: demonstrated strong understanding
